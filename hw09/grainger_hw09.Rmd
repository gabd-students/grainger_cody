#For some reason all on its own R has decided to stop using my main folder as the working directory. I have changed nothing about how I import data either. When i use getwd() my console tells me my project folder grainger_cody is the WD ("G:/Documents/BI685/grainger_cody" to be exact) yet when i run "read_csv("data/darters.csv")" it says "Error: 'data/darters.csv' does not exist in current working directory ('G:/Documents/BI685/grainger_cody/hw09')" . I even tried to run my old assignments chunks that had working read_csv code and they all faield this time too. Updated R and reinstalled tidyverse but didnt help. This has not been an issue the entire class until now. It does work when I manually set the WD in the chunk so I might have to do that every chunk. when i remove the setwd it fails again.

setwd('G:/Documents/BI685/grainger_cody')
data("darters")
(drtrs <- read_csv("data/darters.csv"))

(drtrs_f <- filter(drtrs, !species == "tetrazonum", !species == "zonale",!is.na(length)))

```

```{r}
dtr_m <- mutate(drtrs_f,
       total_substrate = minsub+majsub,
       riffle = replace(riffle, riffle==1, "Riffle 1"),
       riffle = replace(riffle, riffle==2, "Riffle 2"),
       sex = replace(sex,sex=="m","Male"),
       sex= replace(sex,sex=="f","Female")
       )

```{r}
grp_dtr <- dtr_m %>%
  group_by(riffle,species,length, depth, velocity) %>%
  summarise(
    length = mean(length),
    velocity = mean(velocity),
    depth = mean(depth)
