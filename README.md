[Polistes metricus life cycle - from beginning to end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9S01eTU-Sg&t=389s>)

This is a video I found interesting showcasing a generalized **life cycle** of *Polistes metricus* paper wasps. I found the video interesting because I am currently studying the same species of paper wasp myself for my thesis. From my own **personal observations** *Polistes metricus* paper wasps can display a variety of behaviors on both a individual and colonial scale. In my current field season working with the new queens I have already seen an array of behaviors from some individual wasps not wanting to leave the nest no matter what I do to encourage them to leave to being chased off upon sight by the same eindividuals repeatedly. Behaviors such as these always interested me.
